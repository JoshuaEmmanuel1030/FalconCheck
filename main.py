The Main Entrance on Forest Street is the primary entry point, leading visitors directly to several key buildings, including LaCava Center (1), an administrative hub, and Bentley Library (2). Close by, Morison Hall (4) and Lindsay Hall (5) are important academic buildings located near the entrance. Continuing into the campus, the core academic area includes Adamian Academic Center (6), Smith Academic Technology Center (7), and Jennison Hall (8), which are centrally located and close to one another, providing convenient access to educational resources. Adjacent to this academic cluster are Rauch Administration Center (9) and Falcone Complex (10), which provide additional administrative support."
                    "The Student Center and Residential Center (19) is a hub for student life, located near Rhodes Hall (18), which serves as Health Services, and is accessible from both Forest Street and Falcon Way. Surrounding residential buildings, such as Orchard North Apartments (20), Orchard South Apartments (21), The Trees (10), and Boylston Apartments (13), are positioned to facilitate easy access to student services and social areas. Collins Hall (15), near Falcon Way, houses the Bentley Bookstore, making it a central location for student supplies. Miller Hall (16), Slade Hall (11), and Forest Hall (17) are also among the residential buildings distributed around the campus, providing convenient accommodations for students."
                    "For dining and social interactions, The Castle (22) and The Cape (23) are notable gathering places near residential areas, fostering a community atmosphere. The campus wellness and safety facilities include University Police and Counseling Center (12), ensuring student safety, and the Wellness Center near the Bentley Police Station. At the eastern end of the campus, the Dana Athletic Center (29) and nearby athletic fields serve as the main facilities for sports and recreation. Additional buildings, like Lewis Hall (30), Fenway (26), and Dovecote (27), contribute to campus life. Parking areas are conveniently placed around the campus perimeter, while North Campus Apartments (34), located separately across Forest Street, offer additional residential options."
